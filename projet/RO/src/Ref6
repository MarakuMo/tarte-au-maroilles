he clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist
for he boasted no great coat went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt
 to play at blindman s buff
scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker s book went home to bed
 he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be 
that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at hide and seek with other houses and forgotten the way out again
 it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge
 who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful
 meditation on the threshold
now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning 
during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him sixteen as any man in the city of london even including which is a bold word the corporation
 aldermen and livery let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon 
and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not
 a knocker but marley s face
marley s face it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
 it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look  with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air
 and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control
 rather than a part of its own expression
as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again
to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue but he put his hand upon the key
 he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle
he did pause with a moment s irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marley s pigtail
 sticking out into the hall but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with a bang
the sound resounded through the house like thunder every room above and every cask in the wine merchant s cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own 
scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went
you seventeen may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase
 and taken it broadwise with the splinter bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy there was plenty of width for that and room to spare
 which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn t have lighted the entry too well
 so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge s dip
up scrooge went not caring a button for that darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right
 he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
sitting room bed room lumber room all as they should be nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate
 spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressing gown 
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall lumber room as usual old fire guard old shoes two fish baskets washing stand on three legs and a poker
quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in double locked himself in which was not his custom thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat
 put on his dressing gown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
 the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures there were cains and abels pharaoh s daughters
 queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butter boats hundreds of figures to attract
 his thoughts and yet that face eighteen of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophet s rod and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape
 some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marley s head on every one
humbug said scrooge and walked across the room
after several turns he sat down again as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose 
now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing
 it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house
this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour the bells ceased as they had begun together they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person
 were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant s cellar scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
the cellar door flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door
it s humbug still said scrooge i won t believe it
his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried 
i know him marley s ghost and fell again
the same face the very same marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coat skirts and the hair upon his head 
the chain he drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cash boxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds 
and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind
